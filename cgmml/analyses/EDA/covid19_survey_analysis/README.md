In order to understand the impact of covid and ground situations of these migrant families and the effect of the situation in villages at Gram panchayat levels, a detailed survey was conducted in total 666 villages of Chhatarpur
and Sheopur districts with support of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), Welthungerhilfe (WHH) and partner organisations – Mahatma Gandhi Seva Ashram (MGSA) and Darshna Mahila Kalyan Samiti (DMKS).

The Panchayat Survey was designed in a way to gain in-depth insights and details of migrants
at Panchayat level to know and analyse the various means how the migrants were assisted in the
COVID-19 crises after their return (Health, containment, recordkeeping, food, nutrition, livelihood,
etc).

Dataset used in the jupyter notebook involved the Panchayat level Survey to find the feature importance for the incidence of covid cases in the panchayat.
