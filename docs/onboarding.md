# Onboarding

This folder quickly briefs about how to use the Azure ML to:

- Visualize data
- Submit a training job to a gpu-cluster

## Visualization
In the [data_visualization/](../cgmml/data_utils/data_visualisation) notebooks:

1. Access the azure ML Workspace
1. Access a dataset and mount it on your machine
1. Plot some images of the data

## Training a network
In [Onboarding.ipynb](./Onboarding.ipynb) notebook,

1. Access your azure ML Workspace
1. Access a dataset and mount it on your machine
